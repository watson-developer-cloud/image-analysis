# Image Analysis

## DEPRECATED: this repo is no longer actively maintained. It can still be used as reference, but may contain outdated or unpatched code.


  The Image Analysis app let you recognize items in images and speak the resulting description. It uses Visual Recognition to identify objects in images, Machine Translation to translate the description into another language, and Text to Speech to pronounce the resulting translation.
